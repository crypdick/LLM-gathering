6 – Conducive to intimacy, high levels of sharing, and discussion through storytelling.

12 to 15 – Small enough to build trust and intimacy. Large enough to offer a diversity of opinion and to allow for mystery and intrigue or constructive unfamiliarity. (Table Group)

30 – Starts to feel like a party. Has a distinctive crackle of energy and sense of possibility. Generally too big for a single conversation.
