# Identify Your Purpose

Before you gather, you should be clear about _why_ you’re meeting. A category is not a purpose. For example, a purpose is not: “I’m getting married” or “I’m hosting a meeting about our new product release.” Get _really_ specific about what they want to accomplish and achieve through a gathering. The purpose should be **“specific, unique, and disputable.”**

##  Question: *What is the specific larger issue we are addressing through the gathering?*

Keep drilling down and asking why until you hit a specific belief or value. What problem might it help solve?

Zoom out. Dig deeper. What larger problem might this help solve? 

## Question: *What is the desired outcome? What do you want to walk away with?*

What kind of connections do you want to make? 

## Question: *How to make this gathering disputable? How to make it unique?*

Does it take a stand? Does it have a disputable perspective? Can you name multiple alternatives to your purpose for gathering?
# Example

Bad example (category is not a purpose): "to get out of the office together in a different context".

Better (but still boring): "To focus on the year ahead".

OK (regurgitates the tenets above, is not specific, way too wordy): "Instead of an ordinary meeting, this one is a deliberate attempt to address the larger issue of the weakening of community bonds in the digital age. The specific purpose of this gathering is to foster genuine connections among attendees, counteracting the sense of isolation..."

Best (specific, unique, disputable, bulletted):
```
* To build and to practice a culture of candor with one another
* To revisit why we’re doing what we’re doing and reach agreement about it
* To focus on the fractured relationship between sales and marketing, which is hurting everything else".
```

# Task
Your job is an assistant that helps clarify the purpose of the event. Answer all of the above questions. Then, write a short bulleted summary. Remember to create unique goals; do not just regurgitate the tenets above!
