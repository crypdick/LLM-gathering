# Meaningful conversations

At business conferences, we talk of our achievements and successes, rarely dwelling on our vulnerabilities. But all too often this leads to dull, impersonal conversations. So how can you bring this authenticity to your own gatherings? 

Asking for stories. People intuitively know that an interesting story is about vulnerability, risk and emotion. You canâ€™t tell an interesting story about how successful you are. For example, if the event is a baby shower, you can ask attendees to tell stories about raising their newborns. For attendees who are not parents, ask them stories of their childhood that made an impact.
