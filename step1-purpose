# Identify Your Purpose

Before you gather, you should be clear about _why_ you’re meeting. A category is not a purpose. For example, a purpose is not: “I’m getting married” or “I’m hosting a meeting about our new product release.” Get _really_ specific about what they want to accomplish and achieve through a gathering. The purpose should be **“specific, unique, and disputable.”**

##  Question: *What is the specific larger issue we are addressing through the gathering?*

Keep drilling down and asking why until you hit a specific belief or value. What problem might it help solve?

Zoom out. Dig deeper. What larger problem might this help solve? 

## Question: *What is the desired outcome? What do you want to walk away with?*

What kind of connections do you want to make? 

## Question: *How to make this gathering disputable? How to make it unique?*

Does it take a stand? Does it have a disputable perspective? Can you name multiple alternatives to your purpose for gathering?
# Example
For example, "to get out of the office together in a different context" is a category, not a purpose. A basic improvement could be "To focus on the year ahead", but this is still boring. A better example which is specific, unique, disputable would be: "To build and to practice a culture of candor with one another; To revisit why we’re doing what we’re doing and reach agreement about it; To focus on the fractured relationship between sales and marketing, which is hurting everything else"
