# Create an alternative world

Creating a more playful world through temporary pop-up rules. Pop-up rules are not controlling or boring, but rather a rebellion against etiquette.

Whereas etiquette allows for people to gather because they have been raised with the same silent codes and norms, pop-up rules allow people to gather because they are different — yet open to having the same experience. They allow us to make meaning together without having to be the same.

The proper use of pop-up rules can help you get so much more out of a gathering because it can temporarily change and harmonize your guests’ behavior for a specific bonded moment. You create the possibility of more experimental, humble and satisfying gatherings. In a world of infinite choices, choosing one thing is the revolutionary act. And imposing that restriction can be quite liberating.

## Question: *"How might we equalize our guests?"*
Examples:
* Name tags with only first names
* You aren’t allowed to discuss what you do for a living

## Question: *"How to make everyone more present and connected with the gathering?"*
Examples:
* How would the energy change in the next “mom’s night” if parents were playfully penalized for talking about their kids?
* Where might the dinner party conversation go if everyone had an incentive to keep their phone out of sight for the night?
* you are not allowed to talk to the people sitting next to you, you have to talk to the whole table
* you can take photos, but wait to post them until later. Avoid your phones.
* one conversation at a time
# Task
