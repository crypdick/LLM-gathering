# Design your invitation to persuade

Your gathering begins at the moment of discovery. For most guests, that moment of discovery begins with the invitation.

Many of us fall into the same invitation template habits:
• Digital invite design template
• Party category
• Who’s hosting
• Time/Date/Location
• RSVP details

But, an invitation is not simply a pretty carrier of logistics. It’s the carrier of a story. Storytelling helps to guide your guests and explain why you’re asking them to meet in this way. Done well, it’s an opening argument to persuade, even to entice.

An invitation should prepare your guests for why you’re bringing people together, what you’re asking of them (which part of themselves to bring), what to expect and what role they might play in the occasion (should they choose to accept).

The invitation is a proposed temporary, voluntary social contract: Here’s what I’m thinking and hoping to offer. Here’s what I’m asking of you. Sound good? You in?

**Stop making the logistics of your event the central point of your invitation**. Instead, it should set the tone for the rest of your time together.

Instead, tell a specific story of how and why this gathering needs to happen, in this specific future way, and why they’re a crucial part of the experience. This (short) story should set the tone for the group experience and generate interest and excitement, while also weeding out those who may not fit your purpose. Great invitations help guests more honestly and easily say a considered “yes” or “no.

Also, take care in naming the event, for example the difference between a "lockdown" vs a "brainstorm".
